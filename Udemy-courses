The Complete Junior to Senior Web Developer Roadmap (2021) : https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap/

I've finished the first one, and still going throught the second. While I've learned the basic of MongoDB, Express, Node.js and etc. from FreeCodeCamp, I reviewed them once again
in the first course. The only thing new is probably git bash and deploying on Heroku. 
I'm expecting to learn a lot more from the second given that I hardly recognize any of the topics, such as SPA vs server side rendering.
